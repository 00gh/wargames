Well done! You have successfully hacked into the WOPR computer! Your parents   are nagging you to clean up the trash and ask if "your little friend" Jennifer  wants to stay for tea. Apparently they are BBQing tonight. You disconnect your  session and shutdown your computer. Jennifer goes home, and you go down for yourtea. Your parents see a letter from the school with your grades. Your father is very pleased! You then see the news on TV, where they are reporting that someonehas hacked into Norad and almost started WWIII. Was that someone you? It could  be! Worried that it is you (almost sure in fact), you go up to your room and    throw away all traces that you had hacked into the WOPR, phone numbers, print   outs. Everything! Just when you think all is fine, the phone rings. You hear a  modem carrier, so place the receiver into the acoustic coupler....

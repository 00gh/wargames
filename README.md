Wargames Simulator written in BASIC
by Andy Glenn

This is a Wargames Simulator written in BASIC. It has been developed using BASIC-80 on CP/M, but could be easily ported to other platforms. To save space in memory, the help pages use text files which are included in the project.

You are free to use and modify the code for your own purposes, but must credit the author, Andy Glenn, under all circumstances.
